### Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Use FontAwesome in an Android App

#### Instructor: Gianluca Segato

In this tutorial, I will show you how to use the FontAwesome icon set in an Android project. FontAwesome is widely known, very rich, and free. The result is sharp and crisp icons, even on high resolution displays. As an added bonus, changing an icon's size or color is as simple as changing an XML attribute.
